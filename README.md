# Personal Website

## Description 

This [Personal Website](mattdack.github.io/personal-website), is acting as an introduction to my coding experience, a display of my coding portfolio, and listing of contact information. The webpage utilizes semantic HTML:5 and CSS to aesthetically generate a landing page with professional photo, a section describing me, a section for my portfolio, and a section for contact information. Flexbox and relative positioning were used to generate the layout. The page is responsive to different screen sizes.
